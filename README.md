# Recipe Landing Page Project

Welcome to my Recipe Landing Page project! This repository is a part of my journey in learning web development. In this project, I'm in the process of creating a simple yet functional recipe landing page that will showcase three delicious recipes. Each recipe will be a link that directs you to a separate web page with detailed instructions and ingredients.

## Project Goals

- **HTML & CSS Practice**: I'm using HTML and CSS to build the structure and style of this landing page. This project serves as a hands-on exercise to improve my web development skills and create visually appealing web pages.

- **Navigation**: The project will feature a navigation bar at the top of the landing page for easy access to each of the three recipe pages.

- **Recipes**: Once completed, you'll be able to click on each recipe card to explore the individual recipe pages. These pages will provide detailed instructions on how to prepare these mouthwatering dishes.

## Current Status

As of now, this project is a work in progress, and I'm actively developing and refining it. The landing page and recipe pages are still under construction. You can check out the code in this repository to see the development process in action.

## Getting Involved

While the project is not yet complete, your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated. Feel free to open issues or reach out if you have any ideas or recommendations. I'm excited to continue working on this project and sharing the progress with the community.

Stay tuned for updates, and thank you for your interest in my web development journey!
